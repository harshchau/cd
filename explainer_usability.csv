Jenny,386377,1,Users who registered since 10 days ago to now,The summary discusses customers who registered in the past 10 days in New York time zone retrieving their ids by joining the customer and user tables on aiq_id and grouping by aiq_id.,Success,n/a,Success,n/a,Success,,Unsure at what level of granuarly the joins and grouping information needs to include. Information on table joins using aiq_id and joining by aiq_id may be helpful in scenarios where customer has multiple levels of granularity but otherwise would always default to customer level and the description doesn't include what aiq_id anyways so this information seems more TMI.
Jenny,357301,1,Users who browsed the site last (rolling) 30 days and are most engaged category with more than 4 site visits,The summary identifies certain customers who have performed a specific action at least 5 times over the past 30 days.,Fail,Specific action performed is not defined so it's not super helpful in defining the audience,Fail,Same as Column H,Fail,Same as Column H,
Jenny,364524,1,Users who have non-empty or n/a email address and had event action in clickstream data of form_started and form,The SQL joins two tables aiq_customers_base__latest and either clickstream__latest or users__latest. It is looking for aiq_ids that meet certain criteria in both tables. From aiq_customers_base__latest it takes all aiq_ids. From clickstream__latest it looks for aiq_ids where the event_action is 'form_started' and the event_action is 'form' indicating the user started and submitted a form. From users__latest it looks for aiq_ids where the email is not empty or 'N/A'. The INTERSECT finds the aiq_ids that meet the criteria in both tables. So it is finding users who started and submitted a form and have a valid email address.,Not sure,Assuming that this logic explained in words is accurate but would require verifying against the sql audience logic which i cannot do,Success,Same as Column H,Fail,Written out as the sql logic rather than summarizing a description,
Jenny,397182,1,Users with $250+ investable assests and High Income (where Income greater than $200k) including propensity to invest in stock market next 12months but excluding users who completed registration,The query retrieves aiq_ids of customers who are registered companies spending over $250000 or registered users spending over $250000 except those who have completed registration.,Fail,Does not include description on qualifiying audience,Fail,Same as Column H,Success,"""The query retrieves aiq_ids"" beginning might not be needed but still can be helpful",
Jenny,294047,1,Users who have dental or vision product names including company size between 5 to 10k employees and id_type is user but excluding do not contact audience (includes users with email opt in is false),"This audience is used to target employees at Large Enterprise Accounts in order to increase group benefits x-sell and voluntary benefits enrollment. This summarizes the attributes and business logic used to identify a subset of AIQ customer IDs based on criteria involving their purchase history company size opt-in status and ID type. It first finds IDs of customers who purchased dental or vision products. It then intersects this with IDs of customers from companies with 6000-10000 employees. It intersects this again with IDs of customers with a user ID type. Finally it removes any IDs of customers who have opted out of emails.",Success,Seems to be correct (but not 100% sure since I'd need to validate against sql logic),Success,,Success,Seems a bit more complex but the granualar detail is helpful to understand the complete definition of the qualify + suppression audiences.,For a composite audience - this level of details seems to be helpful to understand the criteria for the qualify + suppression audiences despite being lengthy
Jenny,334087,1,Users who signed up for free subscription (where event name is trail signup and event date since last 120 days) including users who added to watchlist podcast listener and browsed subscription plans while removing users last active 6 months ago educators + students and returned churned subscriber,,,,,,,,

Matt,272755,1,"This audience will select any users that have had at least one ""clicked"" email event.",The query retrieves the aiq_id values from the aiq_customers_base table for customers who have clicked on an email. It does this by joining the aiq_customers_base and email_activity tables on aiq_id filtering for email events containing 'clicked' and grouping by aiq_id to eliminate duplicates.,Success,,Success,,Fail,Seems too technical/granular for business-friendly people. Talks immediately about specific tables and columns and SQL logic.,
Matt,406091,1,This audience will select users that are female have dry skin and have spent an average net_price of at least 100,This SQL query identifies customers with high average order values who match a demographic profile. It selects customer IDs from the customer table that have average order values over $100 as calculated by averaging the net prices of their ordered products. It intersects this with customer IDs from the demographics table that have a last name matching 'dry skin' and a gender of 'female'. The query groups by customer ID in both cases to isolate unique high-value female customers with dry skin.,Success,,Success,,Fail,Very technical and dives directly into SQL logic.,"I think ""high average order values who match a demographic profile."" is a hallucination; there is no indication in this audience that this is for high average orders this is just for averages > 100."

Specifically the audience selects customer IDs from the customer base table that have at least 3 events in the clickstream table in the past 3 days. It intersects this with customer IDs from the customer base and user info tables that have at least an email phone number first name or last name provided. It intersects this again with customer IDs from the customer base table that do not contain ""fabrick id"".",Fail,"This is just a 3 day look back I don't see any criteria for at least 3 events. It qualifies people containing fabrick id in the aiq_id not filter out.",Not sure,I think it was complete in explaining all of the query but it seems wrong.,Fail,I think the first sentence was actually a pretty good description but it goes a bit too far.,
Matt,428457,1,This audience will select users that are Xfinity Customers have more than 2 devices have visited the upgrade plans page is a live tv viewer is not opted out of emails and was not last active 6 months ago.,The query filters audiences using multiple criteria including engagement with video content visiting a pricing page watching live TV being an existing customer and having valid contact information.

Specifically it retrieves the aiq_id from the aiq_customers_base table and left joins it with the clickstream table on aiq_id. It then filters for records where the event_action equals 'subscribe' and groups the results by aiq_id to eliminate duplicates. This produces a list of unique customer ids who have subscribed.,Success,,Success,,Fail,I think the second half is a bit too granular/complex for a description.,
Matt,272755,2,"This audience will select any users that have had at least one ""clicked"" email event.","Here is the final summary after 5 iterations:This summarizes the transformation logic of an audience looking to identify customer IDs where the email event contained 'clicked'. It uses the aiq_customers_base table to get the aiq_id field. It left joins the email_activity table using the aiq_id field from both tables as the join key. It then filters the results to only those rows where the email_event field contains 'clicked' lowercased. Finally it groups the results by aiq_id to deduplicate.",Success,,Success,,Fail,Way too technical/granular. Starts talking about transformation logic and specific tables/columns.,"Not sure why it said ""Here is the final summary after 5 iterations"" in the output."
Matt,406091,2,This audience will select users that are female have dry skin and have spent an average net_price of at least 100,The summary describes customers with high average order values who match a demographic profile of female with dry skin. It identifies the customers by intersecting those with average order values over $100 with those matching the demographic profile. The average order value is calculated by averaging the net prices of products on the orders for each customer. The demographic profile matching checks the gender and last name fields for the values female and dry skin.,Success,,Success,,Fail,I think the first sentence is good but it starts to explain way too much about the technicals of the actual query.,
